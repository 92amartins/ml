# Machine Learning algorithms
This repository holds some machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. Of course, all of them were proposed by third parties.
I haven't proposed any of these algorithms.

You're welcome to help improve this code. You can create issues, but as I'm not sure how much effort I'll give you to that, Pull
requests are preferred. Contributions may be one or all of the following:

- Improve readability
- Redesign the overall architecture
- Make code more efficient
- anything else you want...
